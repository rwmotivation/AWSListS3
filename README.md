# AWSListS3
Here's a simple Python script to list all S3 buckets using the AWS SDK for Python, Boto3. I'll also provide instructions on how to set it up and run it. You can then upload it to GitHub.

#1. How to Set Up and Run the Script
Install Boto3: Ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
<code>pip install boto3</code>

<b>Boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python that allows developers to interact with AWS services like S3, EC2, and more. It provides a simple, Pythonic way to manage and automate AWS resources programmatically.</b>

#2. Configure AWS CLI: Before running the script, please ensure you have configured your AWS CLI with your credentials. You can do this by running:
<code>aws configure</code>
You must enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, default region, and output format.

#3. Clone/Download this script 

#4. Run the Script: Once the setup is done, you can run the script:
<code>python list_s3_buckets.py</code>

<i>Share the Repository: You can now share the repository URL with others or use it as a reference in your projects.</i>
