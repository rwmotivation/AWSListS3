# AWSListS3
Here's a simple Python script to list all S3 buckets using the AWS SDK for Python, Boto3. I'll also provide instructions on how to set it up and run it. You can then upload it to GitHub.

#How to Set Up and Run the Script
Install Boto3: Ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
<code>pip install boto3</code>
